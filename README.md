This plugin leverages the TeamCity Cloud API in order to start and dispose TeamCity agents hosted in Docker 
containers on demand. Containers can be configured, and tested, directly from the TeamCity configuration interface.
This cloud provider also has built-in support for Official TeamCity agent images, and resolve them automatically
according to your TeamCity version.

## Requirements
- TeamCity 10.x or greater.
- A Docker daemon accessible through either TCP, Unix Socket, or Windows name pipe and supporting the remote API v1.24 
(Engine version 1.12.x).

Browser requirements are the same than TeamCity itself (IE9+ or recent version of Firefox/Chrome/Safari/Opera/Edge).

## Quick start
1. Upload the plugin archive using the "_Administration_ | _Plugin List_" section of your TeamCity instance, or copy it
to the _plugins_ subfolder in the TeamCity Data Directory.
2. Access the cloud configuration page ("_Administration_ | _Agent Cloud_") and add a new cloud profile using _Docker_ as Cloud type.
3. Configure the access settings to your Docker instance.
4. Register and configure a Docker image hosting the build agent. You can test the image directly from the same configuration page.

By default, the [official TeamCity agent images](https://hub.docker.com/r/jetbrains/teamcity-agent/) will be used. These
images are usable without any additional configuration, but you may need to tune the container settings a little depending on your build requirements.

## Build
This project uses Gradle [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) scripts to build and package the plugin. To create the plugin archive simple run the
<code>tcDist</code> task using the provided gradle wrapper:

```bash
./gradlew tcDist
```
